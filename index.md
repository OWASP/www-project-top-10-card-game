<p>A primary requirement for the game is that it be designed around the standard set of playing cards so that the general public is familiar with the medium facilitating internationalization. The standard two player configuration includes one TA deck and one DC deck for each gamer. The Threat Agent (TA) deck includes two Joker cards that are used to represent a Phishing attack. This brings the TA’s deck to a total of 54. The Defense Control (DC) deck also includes two joker cards that are used to represent White Hat defensive controls. This also brings the DC deck to a total of 54.</p>

<p>During game design, a blue color deck was used to represent the DC team and a red color deck (of the same manufacture) was used to represent the malicious TA team. Cybersecurity activities and training are frequently designed around the concept of red (attacking) and blue (defending) teams.</p>

<p>The focus of the game is on the TA’s attack phase. The game objective is to attack and defeat (PWN) your opponent’s three DC business websites. At the start of each TA attack round, each player draws sufficient cards to ensure they have 5 cards in both the TA attack hand and the DC business hand. The TA selects an attack card (A1 through A9). If the DC opponent is unable to defense the attack card, the attack is successful. See the Card Attack / Defense Matrix and the instructions about TA Exploit Activities below.</p>

<li>Technology Infrastructure - The suit colors (red and black) represent different technology infrastructures. Infrastructure attack and defense options, strengths and weaknesses may result from color combinations. TAs learn about company weaknesses by using different paths to exploit business, social and technical weaknesses. Each of these paths represents a risk that may, or may not, be serious. Sometimes these paths are trivial to find and exploit, and sometimes they are extremely difficult.</li>

<h2 id="owasp_top_10_card_game___roadmap">OWASP Top 10 Card Game - Roadmap</h2>
<p>Phase 1 of the project is complete and it resulted in the completion of the proof of concept, mission statement, short team goals, long team goals and a basic game prototype.</p>
<p>Phase 2 of the project includes assistance from the OWASP foundation, setting up a project Wiki page, setting up a GitHub page, and adding the project to the OWASP project inventory (Incubator Status).</p>
<p>Phase 3 of the project includes looking for other people to help lead and contribute to the project. Areas of need and the corresponding volunteer are listed in the “Getting Involved” section of this Wiki.</p>
<p>Phase 4 will move the project to the Labs phase.</p>
<p>Phase 5 will move the project to the Flagship phase.</p>
<p>Phase 6 addresses the project’s long team goals. It will incorporate the basic OWASP Top 10 Card Game as presented in the Flagship phase along with special customized card decks that will be available through OWASP. These are standard poker decks that have been modified to enhance the game’s learning experience.
