## Game Overview

The game is designed to be an easy to learn introduction to the risk
concepts of the OWASP Top Ten and the best practices control concepts of
the OWASP Top Ten Proactive Controls at a novice level in an environment
that reflects a sense realism and excitement.

  - The OWASP Top 10 focuses on identifying the most serious web
    application security risks for a broad array of organizations. A
    primary aim of the OWASP Top 10 is to educate developers, designers,
    architects, managers, and organizations about the consequences of
    the most common and most important web application security
    weaknesses.

<!-- end list -->

  - The OWASP Top 10 Proactive Controls is similar to the OWASP Top 10
    but is focused on defensive techniques and controls as opposed to
    risks. Each OWASP Top 10 Proactive Control technique maps to one or
    more items in the OWASP Top 10.

The four main components of the game (See GitHub -
<https://github.com/OWASP/Top-10-Card-Game/>) include:

  - Threat Agent (TA) deck
  - Defense Control (DC) deck
  - Game Play Grid
  - Game Rules and Instructions

The objective of the game is to take control of (PWN) your opponent’s
three business websites while protecting your business websites. It is
possible to knockout all three of your opponents TA attack websites.
Primary requirements for the game are that it be designed around the
standard set of playing cards so that the general public is familiar
with the medium facilitating internationalization and that the play grid
fit easily on the standard sized card table.

The standard two player configuration includes one TA deck and one DC
deck for each gamer. The Threat Agent (TA) deck includes two Joker cards
that are used to represent a Phishing attack. This brings the TA’s deck
to a total of 54 cards. The Defense Control (DC) deck also includes two
joker cards that are used to represent White Hat defensive controls.
This also brings the DC deck to a total of 54 cards.

## Game Play Grid

The game’s detailed play grid (See GitHub -
<https://github.com/OWASP/Top-10-Card-Game/>) is based in part on the
attack path flow diagram provided with OWASP’s Top 10 publication. The
play grid is designed to help students visualize how threat agents can
potentially use many different paths through your application to do harm
to your business or organization. The standard two player (four deck)
version of the play grid can be summarized as follows:

![View from 3,000 meters](OWASP_Card_Game_Grid_Summary.jpg
"View from 3,000 meters")

The detailed version of the play grid contains instructional content and
provides visual continuity for players:

## Cards

During game design, four standard poker size playing card decks were
used. Each player has one Threat Agent (TA) deck that represents the
player’s attack team and one Defense Control (DC) deck that represents
the player’s website defense team. Red TA decks and blue DC decks were
used during game design.

Threat Agent (TA) attack deck – 54 cards

  - 12 Face Cards: The face cards (4 Suits X 3 = 12) are held in a
    separate deck. The players select their unique combination that must
    include one Jack, one Queen, and one King. The remaining 9 cards are
    set aside.
  - 40 TA Attack Cards: There are 40 cards (4 Suits X 10 = 40) that are
    included in the primary TA attack deck. The 12 face cards are not
    included in the 40 card TA attack deck.
  - 2 Joker Cards: There are 2 Joker cards included in the primary TA
    attack deck.

Defense Control (DC) deck – 54 cards

  - 12 Face Cards: The face cards (4 Suits X 3 = 12) are held in a
    separate deck. The players select their unique combination that must
    include one Jack, one Queen, and one King. The remaining 9 cards are
    set aside.
  - 40 DC Cards: There are 40 cards (4 Suits X 10 = 40) that are
    included in the primary DC deck. The 12 face cards are not included
    in the 40 card DC defense deck.
  - 2 Joker Cards: There are 2 Joker cards included in the primary DC
    deck.

Strength and weaknesses may vary among face cards (Jack, Queen, and
King), suits (Clubs, Spades, Diamonds, and Hearts), card colors (black
and red) and the site card’s face up/down position. Clubs and Spades are
black and Diamonds and Hearts are red. Other colors can be substituted
as needs require. The game is designed around the standard
international, four suit, and two color (red and black) poker deck.

The Masked / Unmasked status (face down / face up) of the attacking and
defending sites will affect the strength and weaknesses of the opposing
sites (face cards). Face down TA site cards may have more flexible
attack options and may be more difficult to defense and face down DC
site cards may limit some TA attacks or trigger additional TA workload
counts. The following design, of an OWASP branded card set, was drafted
during the initial proof of concept phase to provide how the cards might
look.

![Sample of Card Fronts](OWASP_Game_Card_Sample_Draft_2.jpg
"Sample of Card Fronts")

## Setup

The game’s play grid should be laid out at the start of each game and
each player should have ready:

  - Two draw card stacks (one TA team and one DC team).
  - Two empty discard card stacks (one TA team and one DC team).
  - Two 5 card hands (one TA team and one DC team). After shuffling,
    each player selects the top 5 cards from each of their two 40 card
    decks.
  - Three DC site face cards should be positioned face down on the
    playing grid, one in each of the three Business Site positions.
    These cards should include one Jack, one Queen, and one King of any
    suit. Individual player strategy will determine the suit mixture.
  - Three TA site face cards should be positioned face down, one in each
    of the TA offline bays. These cards should include one Jack, one
    Queen, and one King of any suit. Individual player strategy will
    determine the suit mixture.
  - Each TA face card should be accompanied by a workload counter (dice)
    or small piece of paper to keep track of the workload counts.

## Start of Play

1.  The three DC site face cards (business websites) are considered
    online. The DC business site cards will be turned face up as they
    fall victim to a successful TA Observation attack.
2.  Each player must move at least one of their TA site face cards
    (attacking site) from the inactive offline rack to the primary
    online position. The cost is one workload count added to each TA
    face card moved to an online position. All three TA site face cards
    may be moved into an online position at the cost of one workload
    count each.
3.  A coin toss (rock, paper, scissors, etc.) determines who starts game
    play with the first attack.

## Attack Phase

The focus of the game is on the TA’s attack phase. The game objective is
to attack and defeat (PWN) your opponent’s three DC business websites.
At the start of each TA attack round, each player draws sufficient cards
to ensure they have 5 cards in both the TA attack hand and the DC
business hand. The TA selects an attack card (A1 through A9). If the DC
opponent is unable to defense the attack card, the attack is successful.
See the Card Attack / Defense Matrix and the instructions about TA
Exploit Activities below.

The TA may withdraw the current primary online attack face card and
replace it with another attack face card from the online rack at no
cost. Whenever a card is moved from the offline rack to the online rack,
one workload counter should be added to the card moved online. There is
no cost to reposition an online card or return an online card to the
offline position.

  - If the move to online results in more than x workload counts, the
    TA’s online card is no longer effectively masked (considered
    deprecated) and it is turned face up. Some attacks may be limited.
  - If the move to online results in more than x workload counts, the
    TA’s online card is considered decommissioned and must be returned
    to the offline rack bay.
  - Once turned face up, the TA face card remains face up.

The TA’s attacking card (A1 through A9 and attached A10) is maintained
on the grid position marking the successful exploit. The DC loser has
the option to name any one of the Top 10 Proactive Controls chosen by
the opponent. If correct, two DC cards may be drawn. If incorrect, one
DC card may be drawn. The DC player discards any cards in excess of 5.

When the TA’s attack is defeated:

  - Both the attacking TA card (including any attached A10 card) and the
    defending DC card are moved to their respective discard piles.
  - The TA's attacking site card earns one workload count.
  - The DC victor is permitted to draw up to three bonus DC cards for
    the TA’s attack failure. The DC player discards any cards in excess
    of 5.
  - The defeated TA has the option to name any one of the Top 10 risks
    chosen by the opponent. If correct, no workload count is applied. If
    incorrect two workload counts are applied to the TA face card. The
    TA player may use the “hint” table. At the executive level of play,
    the "hint" table is not permitted.

TA card status:

  - Inactive – Offline rack bay (face down).
  - Active – Online and masked (face down).
  - Active – Online and unmasked/deprecated (face up).
  - Decommissioned – Offline rack bay (face up).

There are three attack vector pathways. Each pathway includes three
defense-in-depth controls that must be defeated:

1.  Technology Infrastructure - The suit colors (red and black)
    represent different technology infrastructures. Infrastructure
    attack and defense options, strengths and weaknesses may result from
    color combinations. TAs learn about company weaknesses by using
    different paths to exploit business, social and technical
    weaknesses. Each of these paths represents a risk that may, or may
    not, be serious. Sometimes these paths are trivial to find and
    exploit, and sometimes they are extremely difficult.
2.  Web Platform - The card suits (Clubs, Spades, Diamonds, & Hearts)
    represent different web platforms. Web platform attack and defense
    options, strengths and weaknesses may result from suit combinations.
    After gaining an understanding of the technologies that support the
    DC’s web platform, malware can be crafted to exploit weaknesses and
    misconfigurations.
3.  Web Application - The face cards (Jack, Queen and King) represent
    sites with different business purposes and different web application
    layer configurations. Application layer component attack and defense
    options, strengths and weaknesses may result from face card
    combinations. The web application layer includes the user interface
    and other critical functions that if exploited could permit the TA
    to control the site.

## Threat Agent (TA) Exploit Activities

Exploits are designed around five TA team activities (three attacks and
two phases):

1.  Observation Attack
2.  Weaponization Phase
3.  Assess Web Platform Technical Weaknesses Attack
4.  Site Application Weakness Evaluation Phase
5.  PWN Attack

Observation Attack – This includes the concepts of profiling, research,
and crafting a reconnaissance strategy. If the TA's Observation Attack
is successful, the TA moves to the Weaponization phase. When an
Observation exploit is defeated by an effective DC card, the attack
round is over. See instructions above for when an attack is defeated.

Weaponization Phase – Based on the results of the Observation phase, the
TA will select the best tools and techniques to achieve a presence in
the system and to eventually gain system exploit. At the beginning of
the Weaponization phase, the TA has several options:

1.  End the round without additional workload cost.
2.  Draw up to 3 additional attack cards. After selecting the best cards
    for the planned exploit, the TA must discard attack cards so the
    hand has no more than 5 cards. The cost of the additional card draw
    is to add one workload count to the TA's attacking face card.
3.  Move online TA face card(s) offline. No cost.
4.  Move offline TA face card(s) online. Cost is one workload count per
    card.
5.  Reposition the TA’s primary online face card to another online
    position and substitute it with another online card. No cost.
6.  Change attack vector path and launch an Observation Attack on
    another DC site. No cost.
7.  Launch an Assess Platform Weakness Attack on this site or change the
    attack vector path and launch an Assess Platform Weakness Attack on
    any other DC site that is vulnerable due to a previously successful
    Observation attack. No cost.
8.  Change attack vector path and launch a PWN Attack on any other DC
    site that is now vulnerable due to a previously successful Assess
    Platform Weakness Attack. No cost.

Assess Web Platform Technical Weaknesses Attack – The purpose of this
attack is to evaluate the information gained from the previous phase,
craft an effective attack, and assess the technical weaknesses of the
opponents DC site web platform. If the attack is successful, the TA
moves to the Site Application Weakness Evaluation phase. If the TA's
technical weakness attack is defeated, the round is over. See
instructions for when an attack phase is defeated.

Site Application Weakness Evaluation Phase – The purpose of this phase
is to evaluate the information gained from the previous phases and craft
an attack that will effectively implement the TA’s goals. At the
beginning of the Site Application Weakness Evaluation phase, the TA has
several options:

1.  End the round without additional workload cost.
2.  Draw up to 3 additional attack cards. After selecting the best cards
    for the planned exploit, the TA must discard attack cards so the
    hand has no more than 5 cards. The cost of the additional card draw
    is to add one workload count to the TA's attacking face card.
3.  Move online TA face card(s) offline. No cost.
4.  Move offline TA face card(s) online. Cost is one workload count per
    card.
5.  Reposition the TA’s primary online face card to another online
    position and substitute it with another online card. No cost.
6.  Change attack vector path and launch an Observation Attack on
    another DC site. No cost.
7.  Change attack vector path and launch an Assess Platform Weakness
    Attack on another DC site that is vulnerable due to a previously
    successful Observation attack. No cost.
8.  Launch a PWN Attack on this site or change the attack vector path
    and launch a PWN attack on any other DC site that is now vulnerable
    due to a previously successful Assess Platform Weakness Attack. No
    cost.

PWN Attack – The potential results and future actions following the TA’s
PWN attack depend on the status of the TA's attacking face card:

  - If the TA PWN attack is successful, the TA may move to another
    vector path and launch an attack on another DC site or end the round
    without additional workload cost.
  - If the TA is attacking with a face card that is unmasked/deprecated,
    some attacks may be limited.
  - If the TA is attacking with a face card that is not
    unmasked/deprecated and the PWN attack is successful, the TA may
    also pivot and PWN any of the opponent’s unmasked/deprecated online
    TA face cards prior to launching an attack in another path vector or
    ending the round. At the start of the next round, the PWN’d TA face
    cards (now considered decommissioned) must be returned to the
    offline rack bay.

If the TA's PWN exploit is defeated, the round is over. See instructions
for when an attack phase is defeated.

| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Observation Attack - If the TA site is not masked, the color of TA’s attacking card (A1 through A9) must match the color (red or black) of the TA’s attack site card. For example, an attacking unmasked TA Queen of Hearts (Red) may only use a Red (Diamond or Heart) attack (A1 through A9) card.                                                     |
| Assess Web Platform Technical Weaknesses Attack - If the TA site is not masked, the suit of the TA’s attacking card (A1 through A9) must match the suit (hearts, diamonds, spades, or clubs) of the defending DC site card.                                                                                                                              |
| PWN Attack - If the TA site is not masked, the attacking TA site (Queen or King) must match the face card (Queen or King) of the defending DC site card. An unmasked Jack may still attack any other face card. For example, an attacking unmasked TA Queen of Hearts may only launch a PWN attack against a DC Queen (Hearts, Diamond, Club or Spades). |
